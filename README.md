------------------------
## About
This came about because I couldn't find a way to relate AniList IDs to TVDB or TMDB IDs for my project [AniPlanrr](https://github.com/noggl/AniPlanrr). The matching could only be done by name, and that was not reliable enough. This script uses [Fribb's anime-lists](https://github.com/Fribb/anime-lists) and [manami-project's AOD](https://github.com/manami-project/anime-offline-database) to create a CSV file that can be used to relate AniList IDs to TVDB or TMDB IDs.

Both of these resources are .json files housed in the project's github repo, so this project downloads those files and parses them to create the CSV file.

## Requirements
- Python 3
- git

## Usage

Run the script with `python3 createCSV.py`. This will clone/update the github repos and create the `mappings.csv` to be used in a program like [AniPlanrr](https://github.com/noggl/AniPlanrr).

There are 2 available flags, `-f` and `-g`, which will force the creation of the CSV file or commit to github respectively. The first is useful for testing, the second is used in the github action that keeps this repo up to date.
